Bike Rental Prediction

Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Prediction of daily bike rental count based on the environmental and seasonal settings.

Dataset Description
Bike sharing systems are a new version of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has been automated. Through these systems, users are easily able to rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of the important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
